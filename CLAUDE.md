# Claude Code Instructions

## Task Master AI Instructions
**Import Task Master's development workflow commands and guidelines, treat as if import is in the main CLAUDE.md file.**
@./.taskmaster/CLAUDE.md

## Configuration Management
- When adding or changing any of the configuration file entries, always create a NEW example-full-config.toml file that reflects the current state, with ALL settings and default values.

## Development Guidelines
- Remember - we need to maintain Windows and MacOS compatibility for all file path references.
- Always use publicly available and strongly supported modules and libraries before writing from scratch.
